IPv6 
, 
formerly

, 
is 
the 
latest 
version 
of 
the 
Internet 
Protocol 
( 
IP 
) 
. 

IP 
 
is 
a 
packet

protocol 
used 
to 
exchange 
data

security 
, 
quality 
of 
service 
( 
QoS 
) 
, 
and

The 
IPv6

space 
reduces 
the

and 
Network 
Address

routers 
at 
network 
edges 
. 

 
• 
Implementing 
basic 
IPv6 
connectivity 
in 
the 
Cisco 
IOS 
software 
consists 
of 
assigning 
IPv6 
 
addresses 
to 
individual 
router 
interfaces 
. 

The 
forwarding 
of 
IPv6 
traffic 
can 
be 
enabled

and 
Cisco

Forwarding 
switching 
for 
IPv6 
can 
also 
be

• 
The 
primary 
motivation 
for

DESCRIPTION 
 
• 
Wide

Application 
Services 
( 
WAAS 
) 
is 
a 
Cisco 
Systems 
technology 
that 
improves 
the 
 
performance 
of

on 
a 
wide

• 
WAAS 
system 
consists 
of 
a 
set 
of 
devices 
called 
wide

application 
engines 
( 
WAEs 
) 
that 
work 
 
together 
to 
optimize 
TCP 
traffic 
over 
your 
network 
. 

When 
client 
and 
server 
applications 
attempt 
 
to 
communicate 
with 
each 
other 
, 
the 
network 
intercepts 
and 
redirects 
this 
traffic 
to 
the 
WAEs 
so 
 
that 
they 
can 
act 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
client 
application 
and 
the 
destination 
server 
. 

 
• 
The 
WAEs 
examine 
the 
traffic 
and 
use 
built

in 
application 
policies 
to 
determine 
whether 
to 
 
optimize 
the

This 
project 
is 
based 
on 
relay 
circuit 
and 
microcontroller 
which 
control 
the 
 
power 
wastage 
and 
give 
the 
live 
data 
of 
current 
, 
power 
consumption 
and 
power 
 
conservation 
. 

The 
heart 
of 
our 
project 
is 
UNO 
based 
AT 
mega 
328p 
. 

 
Microcontroller 
is 
interfaced 
with 
laptop 
, 
pc 
, 
relay 
circuit 
and 
LCD.Relay 

circuit 
 
provides 
controlled 
power 
supply 
to 
appliances 
like 
fan 
, 
Ac 
. 

There 
is 
an 
external 
5 
 
volt 
is 
supplied 
to 
LCD 
, 
Microcontroller 
and 
Relay 
circuit 
. 

LCD 
is 
used 
for 
live 
 
monitoring 
of 
power 
through 
which 
we 
can 
able 
to 
see 
power 
consumption 
, 
 
power 
conservation 
and 
current 
monitoring 
. 

 
The 
Arduino 
energy 
conservation 
system 
decrease 
the 
power 
lose 
with 
using 
 
sensor 
and 
relay 
circuit 
. 

Arduino 
controller 
board 
will 
be 
used 
along 
with 
 
Temperature 
, 
Humidity 
, 
Light 
& 
Current 
sensor 
for 
data 
gathering 
and 
analysis 
. 

 
Thereof 
depending 
on 
the 
result 
of 
data 
analyses 
, 
relay 
circuits 
will 
be 
activated 
to 
 
control 
the 
home 
appliances 
to 
reduce 
power 
consumption

that 
 
was

Over 
the 
course 
of 
the 
year 
following 
deployment 
, 
several 
changes 
were 
made 
 
in 
an 
attempt 
to 
improve 
the 
containment 
rate 
. 

Based 
on 
the 
analysis 
done 
during 
this 
time 
we 
 
determined 
that 
moving 
away 
from 
the 
natural 
language 
speech 
platform 
and

Project 
: 
Alert 
messaging 
is 
the 
process 
of 
reliably 
and 
securely 
circulating 
messages 
associated 
 
with 
an 
event 
to 
interested 
users 
. 

Due 
to 
the 
growth 
of 
Information 
Technology 
( 
IT 
) 
and 
 
telecommunications 
sectors 
in 
the 
recent 
past 
, 
the 
dissemination 
of 
alert 
messages 
has 
become 
 
prompt 
and 
easier 
. 

 
Since 
the 
existing 
business 
environment 
faces 
the 
challenge 
of 
reaching 
increasingly 
segmented 
 
markets 
, 
the 
design 
, 
delivery 
, 
and 
analysis 
of 
business 
communications 
needs 
to 
be 
tightly 
 
integrated 
across 
multiple 
alert 
notification 
channels 
. 

Telecommunication 
channels 
through 
 
which 
subscribers 
can 
receive 
alert 
messages 
may 
include 
email 
, 
fax 
, 
text 
messaging 
, 
instant 
 
messaging 
, 
broadband 
network 
and 
the 
like 
. 

Due 
to 
myriad 
software 
applications 
implemented 
by 
 
businesses 
and 
the 
vast 
demographics 
of 
customers 
, 
it 
may 
become 
necessary 
to 
segment 
alert 
 
messages 
so 
that 
the 
messages 
can 
be 
sent 
through 
channels 
based 
on 
business 
needs 
as 
well 
 
as 
customer 
preferences 
. 

Further 
, 
in 
order 
to 
maintain 
strong 
customer 
relationships 
, 
businesses 
 
need 
to 
time 
the 
messages 
precisely 
. 

This 
brief 
illustrates 
how 
Alert 
Notification 
System 
( 
IANS 
) 
 
can 
help 
organization 
leverage 
existing 
infrastructure 
to 
better 
service 
their 
customers 
.

May 
2010 
to 
June 
2011 
 
This 
project 
is 
actually 
a 
redesign 
of 
an 
existing 
client 
website 
. 

The 
client 
website 
was 
designed 
 
on 
Java 
Server 
Pages 
( 
JSP 
) 
and 
our 
aim 
was 
to 
change 
it 
into 
a 
more 
dynamic 
web 
page 
using 
 
Adobe 
Flex 
. 

At 
first 
we 
changed 
the 
home 
page 
screen 
of 
the 
client 
website 
. 

After 
the 
successful 
 
completion 
of 
that 
we 
incorporated 
flex 
in 
to 
the 
account 
section 
also 
. 

This 
data 
which 
is 
obtained 
 
from 
DataBase 
is 
taken 
by 
the 
flex 
using 
a 
remote 
procedure 
call 
and 
the 
data 
is 
shown 
to 
the 
 
user 
. 

With 
the 
use 
of 
Advanced 
Data 
Grids 
, 
Charts(including 
Bar 
and 
Pie 
Charts 
) 
the 
site 
increased 
 
the 
readability 
and 
understandability 
of 
the 
users 
who 
were 
previously 
using 
the 
pages 
on 
java 
 
server 
pages 
. 

This 
site 
developed 
by 
us 
won 
the 
IMC 
( 
Interactive 
Media 
Council 
) 
's 
outstanding 
 
achievement 
award 
in 
Financial 
information

judge 
evaluate 
website 
based 
on 
5 
criteria 
: 
 
Design 
, 
Content 
, 
Feature 
Functionality 
, 
Usability 
and 
Standard 
Compliance 
. 

Our

scored 
 
475 
out 
of 
a 
maximum 
of 
500 
points

Description 
: 
Development 
of 
Basel 
II 
Application 
, 
Basel 
II 
is 
the 
second 
of 
the 
Basel 
Accords 
, 
 
which 
are 
recommendations 
on 
banking 
laws 
and 
regulations 
issued 
by 
the 
Basel 
Committee 
on 
 
Banking 
Supervision 
. 

The 
purpose 
of 
Basel 
II 
, 
which 
was 
initially 
published 
in 
June 
2004 
, 
is 
to 
 
create 
an 
international 
standard 
that 
banking 
regulators 
can 
use 
when 
creating 
regulations 
about 
 
how 
much 
capital 
banks 
need 
to 
put 
aside 
to 
guard 
against 
the 
types 
of 
financial 
and 
operational 
 
risks 
banks 
face 
. 

In 
practice 
, 
Basel 
II 
attempts 
to 
accomplish 
this 
by 
setting 
up 
rigorous 
risk 
 
and 
capital 
management 
requirements 
designed 
to 
ensure 
that 
a 
bank 
holds 
capital 
reserves 
 
appropriate 
to 
the 
risk 
the 
bank 
exposes 
itself 
to 
through 
its 
lending 
and 
investment 
practices 
. 

 
The 
New 
Accord 
includes 
several 
methodologies 
for 
determining 
a 
bank 
's 
risk 
-0
based 
capital 
 
requirements 
for 
credit 
, 
market 
and 
operational 
risk 
. 

For 
Risk 
Based 
Capital 
( 
RBC 
) 
, 
Credit 
Usage 
 
( 
CU 
) 
and 
Stress 
Test 
( 
ST 
) 
, 
the 
methodologies 
that 
will 
be 
used 
for 
repo 
style 
transactions 
are 
 
Simple 
VaR 
if 
the 
collateral 
is 
eligible 
. 

If 
the 
collateral 
is 
ineligible 
then 
the 
Wholesale 
loan 
 
approach 
will 
be 
utilized 
or 
the 
collateral 
will 
be 
reduced 
to 
zero 
in 
the 
Simple 
VaR.

bounded 
Anytime 
Window 
 
A*(MAWA 
* 
) 
, 
which 
is 
complete 
, 
anytime 
, 
and 
memory 
bounded 
. 

MAWA 
* 
uses 
the 
window- 
 
bounded 
anytime 
-0
search 
methodology 
of 
AWA 
* 
as 
the 
basic 
framework 
and 
combines 
it 
with 
the 
 
memory 
-0
bounded 
A 
* 
-like 
approach 
to 
handle 
restricted

situations 
. 

 
Simple 
and 
efficient 
versions 
of 
MAWA

It 
is 
a 
transactional

will 
connect 
to 
the 
corporate

and 
download 
data 
from 
the 
forecast 
database 
, 
which 
creates 
an 
offline 
forecast 
workbook 
. 

This 
 
data 
can 
then 
be 
accessed 
offline 
, 
modelled 
, 
and 
changes 
to 
certain 
data 
fields 
are 
subsequently 
 
uploaded 
back 
to 
the 
forecast 
database 
through 
a 
CorpNet 
connection 
. 

These 
changes 
are 
then 
 
stored 
in 
the 
online 
database 
and 
subsequently 
loaded 
back 
into 
upstream 
systems

May 
2010 
to 
June 
2011 
 
This 
project 
is 
actually 
a 
redesign 
of 
an 
existing 
client 
website 
. 

The 
client 
website 
was 
designed 
 
on 
Java 
Server 
Pages 
( 
JSP 
) 
and 
our 
aim 
was 
to 
change 
it 
into 
a 
more 
dynamic 
web 
page 
using 
 
Adobe 
Flex 
. 

At 
first 
we 
changed 
the 
home 
page 
screen 
of 
the 
client 
website 
. 

After 
the 
successful 
 
completion 
of 
that 
we 
incorporated 
flex 
in 
to 
the 
account 
section 
also 
. 

This 
data 
which 
is 
obtained 
 
from 
DataBase 
is 
taken 
by 
the 
flex 
using 
a 
remote 
procedure 
call 
and 
the 
data 
is 
shown 
to 
the 
 
user 
. 

With 
the 
use 
of 
Advanced 
Data 
Grids 
, 
Charts(including 
Bar 
and 
Pie 
Charts 
) 
the 
site 
increased 
 
the 
readability 
and 
understandability 
of 
the 
users 
who 
were 
previously 
using 
the 
pages 
on 
java 
 
server 
pages 
. 

This 
site 
developed 
by 
us 
won 
the 
IMC 
(

's 
outstanding 
 
achievement

5 
criteria 
: 
 
Design

Description 
: 
Development 
of 
Basel 
II 
Application 
, 
Basel 
II 
is 
the 
second 
of 
the 
Basel 
Accords 
, 
 
which 
are 
recommendations 
on 
banking 
laws 
and 
regulations 
issued 
by 
the 
Basel 
Committee 
on 
 
Banking 
Supervision 
. 

The 
purpose 
of 
Basel 
II 
, 
which 
was 
initially 
published 
in 
June 
2004 
, 
is 
to 
 
create 
an 
international 
standard 
that 
banking 
regulators 
can 
use 
when 
creating 
regulations 
about 
 
how 
much 
capital 
banks 
need 
to 
put 
aside 
to 
guard 
against 
the 
types 
of 
financial 
and 
operational 
 
risks 
banks 
face 
. 

In 
practice 
, 
Basel 
II 
attempts 
to 
accomplish 
this 
by 
setting 
up 
rigorous 
risk 
 
and 
capital 
management 
requirements 
designed 
to 
ensure 
that 
a 
bank 
holds 
capital 
reserves 
 
appropriate 
to 
the 
risk 
the 
bank 
exposes 
itself 
to 
through 
its 
lending 
and 
investment 
practices 
. 

 
The 
New 
Accord 
includes 
several 
methodologies 
for 
determining 
a 
bank 
's 
risk 
-0
based 
capital 
 
requirements 
for 
credit 
, 
market 
and 
operational 
risk 
. 

For 
Risk

( 
RBC 
) 
, 
Credit 
Usage 
 
( 
CU 
) 
and 
Stress 
Test 
( 
ST 
) 
, 
the 
methodologies 
that 
will 
be 
used 
for 
repo 
style 
transactions 
are 
 
Simple 
VaR 
if 
the 
collateral 
is 
eligible 
. 

If 
the 
collateral 
is 
ineligible 
then 
the 
Wholesale 
loan 
 
approach 
will 
be 
utilized 
or 
the 
collateral 
will 
be 
reduced 
to 
zero 
in 
the 
Simple 
VaR.

Project 
: 
Automation 
on

Application 
for 
PGE 
project 
 
With 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
new 
platform 
we 
did 
not 
see 
the 
uplift 
in 
call 
containment 
that 
 
was 
expected 
. 

Over 
the 
course 
of 
the 
year 
following 
deployment 
, 
several 
changes 
were 
made 
 
in 
an 
attempt 
to 
improve 
the 
containment 
rate 
. 

Based 
on 
the 
analysis 
done 
during 
this 
time 
we 
 
determined 
that

away 
from 
the 
natural 
language 
speech 
platform 
and 
back 
to 
a 
directed 
 
dialog

Project 
: 
Alert 
messaging 
is 
the 
process 
of 
reliably 
and 
securely 
circulating 
messages 
associated 
 
with 
an 
event 
to 
interested 
users 
. 

Due 
to 
the 
growth 
of 
Information 
Technology 
( 
IT 
) 
and 
 
telecommunications 
sectors 
in 
the 
recent 
past 
, 
the 
dissemination 
of 
alert 
messages 
has 
become 
 
prompt 
and 
easier 
. 

 
Since 
the 
existing 
business 
environment 
faces 
the 
challenge 
of 
reaching 
increasingly 
segmented 
 
markets 
, 
the 
design 
, 
delivery 
, 
and 
analysis 
of 
business 
communications 
needs 
to 
be 
tightly 
 
integrated 
across 
multiple 
alert 
notification 
channels 
. 

Telecommunication 
channels 
through 
 
which 
subscribers 
can 
receive 
alert 
messages 
may 
include 
email 
, 
fax 
, 
text 
messaging 
, 
instant 
 
messaging 
, 
broadband 
network 
and 
the 
like 
. 

Due 
to 
myriad 
software 
applications 
implemented 
by 
 
businesses 
and 
the 
vast 
demographics 
of 
customers 
, 
it 
may 
become 
necessary 
to 
segment 
alert 
 
messages 
so 
that 
the 
messages 
can 
be 
sent 
through 
channels 
based 
on 
business 
needs 
as 
well 
 
as 
customer 
preferences 
. 

Further 
, 
in 
order 
to 
maintain 
strong 
customer 
relationships 
, 
businesses 
 
need 
to 
time 
the 
messages 
precisely 
. 

This 
brief 
illustrates 
how 
Alert 
Notification 
System 
( 
IANS 
) 
 
can 
help 
organization 
leverage 
existing 
infrastructure 
to 
better 
service 
their 
customers 
.
